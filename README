A minimal homepage for minimal browsers
=======================================

This is a simple html page - with some styling -
that I created to use inside one of my favorite web browsers - qute(https://qutebrowser.org).

However, it is also possible to use it as the default page(or the "new tab page")
inside of most modern browsers like brave, firefox, edge etc.
by using third-party browser addons - if it doesn't let you set your own custom url).

One example of such extension is "new tab redirect"
which is available for almost all the popular chromium based browsers.
